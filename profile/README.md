Sleeping AI isn’t just another lab — we’re a force that redefines what AI research should be. We don’t babysit AI; we unleash it, allowing it to drive real, practical breakthroughs. Our mission is clear: open-source datasets, tutorials, and cutting-edge models, all with the goal of advancing humanity.

We work hand-in-hand with our friendly labs to meet our objectives, pushing the boundaries of open-source research. While we plan future closed-source products to fund our research, our focus remains on benefiting humanity, not chasing profits. We're not here to be another Anthropic or OpenAI. We aim to become what Google Brain once was — a place where **innovation** and **research** take priority over flashy products and profitability. No gimmicks. Just pure, unfiltered progress.
