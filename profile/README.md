**Sleeping AI** is a Non-profit organization committed to advanced artificial intelligence research. By advanced artificial intelligence, we mean radical and paradigm shifting ideas and projects that re-thinks on-going research landscapes and pushing creativity and thinking to the utmost limit. 

We are a very small group working in-collaboration with friendly labs, universities and researchers throughout the world, mainly Germany, Israel and European institutions. Our research interests are audio and natural language processing (e.g. scaling laws, generative audio and music modelling, evaluation and benchmarks and large-scale pre-training and post-training datasets). 

We are looking for investors and raise initial seed-funding.
