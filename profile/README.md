**Sleeping AI** is a research-driven lab dedicated to exploring unconventional problems in Artificial Intelligence and Brain-Machine inspired networks. While many focus on trending topics and established problem statements, we aim to tackle the overlooked challenges and pioneer research in emerging areas.

Our mission is to address experimental, curiosity-driven questions that blend AI with Neuroscience, anticipating future trends and shaping new research pathways.

Currently in a limited beta phase, Sleeping AIâ€™s activities are closely aligned with the ongoing projects and contributions of our founder, *sleeping4cat (Ammar)*. We are preparing for a broader launch in the coming months and are committed to advancing the frontier of AI research.
