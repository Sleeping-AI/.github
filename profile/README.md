**Sleeping AI**, an unorthodox artificial intelligence lab, is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI research. We believe that AI models and datasets should be released publicly, prioritizing research benefits over commercial interests and self-serving biases. Our goal is to prevent the creation of overly advanced AI or AGI hype.

We recognize AGI hype as a phenomenon where researchers and reviewers overestimate the capabilities of groundbreaking intelligent models and datasets, believing they could lead to human or near-human level intelligence. At Sleeping AI, we challenge such beliefs and prioritize groundbreaking, high-quality research. We believe in conducting research that aligns with core human ethics and morality, which are fundamental to our nature.
