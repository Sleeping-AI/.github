## Introduction
We’re a collaboration first AI lab. Our key derivative is to develop state-of-art AI infrastructure and models. With the help of AI, we’re committed to solve the most pressing issues in medicine, military, communication, linguistics and automated entities. 

#### How do we operate?
In our lab, we take a hybrid approach whilst working, we combine our internal connections to recruit teammates (project-wise) and outside collaborations with well-known research labs and universities. 

To work with us, we evaluate each individual/entity in following **parameters:**

1. Influence and prestige
2. Previous well-known work
3. Major contributions

After these checks, we perform a certain collaboration. 

##### Computing Infrastructure
We utilise state-of-art hardware and super computers. It all boils down to the specific use-case. In the past, we have performed from XLA Accelerated Computing to distributed torch computing. Translating to have experience in both TPU and GPUs. 

##### Ethics
To develop Human AI, we resort to greek philosophies and utilise core human morality and nature as our ethical guidelines. We ensure no harm being done to any human being.
